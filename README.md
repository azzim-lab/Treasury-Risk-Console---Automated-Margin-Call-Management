# Treasury Risk Console - Automated Margin Call Management

A sophisticated web-based dashboard that simulates treasury/prime brokerage margin call operations with advanced automation, Monte Carlo risk analysis, and real-time market monitoring.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional margin call operations are time-intensive and error-prone:
- **Manual Process**: Treasury teams spend 15+ hours/week manually reviewing trades
- **Delayed Response**: Critical margin shortfalls require immediate attention

### 🔧 Core Automation Features
- **Real-time FX Monitoring**: Live USD/SGD rate tracking with 1% variance triggers
- **Intelligent Trade Analysis**: Automated P&L calculations and collateral assessments
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: 1,000-scenario risk modeling to identify outlier events
- **Smart Alerting**: Automated escalation for critical margin shortfalls
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time KPIs and performance metrics

### 📊 Key Capabilities
- **Trade Portfolio Management**: 150+ daily trades with real-time status monitoring
